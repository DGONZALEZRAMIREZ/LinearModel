# Introduction

Form three regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~GRIP, and Model3 is SIMS~ARM+GRIP. For each model find a 95% prediction interval of SIMS given a value of 94  for GRIP and 88 for ARM. Compare Model1 with Model3 using anova. Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to your github account and submit it back to canvas as link. 

## SIMS~ARM Regression


### Scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

The generic scatter plot above shows that there is a linear trend going uphill and to the right which is a sign of a positively correlated set of data. The greater the pounds of arm force(ARM), the greater the simulation score (SIMS).


## GGPlot

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```

```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```

```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
``` 


The scatter plot above shows the SIMS result as a function of ARM. The data points are each individual score and corresponding arm strength. The blue line indicates the best linear fit to predict SIMS as a function of line. The shaded area is the uncertainty associated with where that blue line would be if you repeated the experiment a large number of times. 
  

### Numerical Results
```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

The number above indicates the correlation between the measure SIMdata <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
S score and ARM force. Correlation is a measure of the linear association between the two variables. 



### Inferential Results
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```


The equation is SIMS = -4.095160 + 0.054563 * ARM 


```{r}
newData=data.frame(GRIP=94,ARM=88)
predict.lm(model.1,newData,interval="prediction")

```

Fit is the predicted ARM score when you have an ARM strength of 88.

The lwr and upr are the 95% confidence intervals for the predicted SIMS scores when ARM score is 88.

## SIMS~GRIP Regression


### Scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```

According to the scatterplot above, GRIP has a smaller correlation with SIMS than is the case with SIMS and ARM. 

## GGPlot

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=GRIP))
```

```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```

```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
``` 


### Numerical Results
```{r}
cor(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```

The number above indicates the correlation between the measure SIMdata <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
S score and ARM force. Correlation is a measure of the linear association between the two variables. 



### Inferential Results
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```


The equation is SIMS = -4.095160 + 0.054563 * ARM 


```{r}
newData=data.frame(GRIP=94,ARM=88)
predict.lm(model.1,newData,interval="prediction")

```
